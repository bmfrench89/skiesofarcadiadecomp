specs/gpu-backend.md V3a, V3b, V4a, V4b and V5's loddiff. `build` compiles the shaders in
runtime/gxv/ to SPIR-V with the pinned glslang (tools/fetch_gpu.py), as C
arrays -- each mutation a variant of its own, tools/soa/shaders.py, which
recompile.py --link uses too -- and builds gx.c, gxr.c, gxr_tev.c, png.c,
gxv.c (the backend, with SOA_GXV=1) and plat.c with the spike's driver into
build/gpuspike/<compiler>/gpuspike.exe, when an input is newer than it. No
gen/, no disc: the binary links the renderer alone, as
tools/citest/render_check.py does.

`selftest` (V3a) runs the binary twice, `--backend cpu` and `--backend gpu`,
into build/gpuspike/<compiler>/cpu and gpu, and judges the scenes they wrote:

- the self test's two render recipes must pass on the GPU as they are
  written for the CPU (the driver checks them in-process);
- cull0..cull3: four triangle shapes in both windings, a strip, a fan and two
  quads under each cull mode. Away from edges the GPU covers exactly what the
  CPU covers and in the same colour; mode 3 covers nothing, mode 0 something;
- clip_*: triangles crossing the near and far planes, orthographic and in
  perspective. Away from edges the coverage matches and colours are within one
  step (the CPU steps attributes along a span, the GPU interpolates them, 3.4);
  and in the driver the vertices the consumer uploaded must be clip_polygon's;
- depth, depth_persp, scissor, quad_gradient and clear: an EQUAL redraw and
  LESS against the clear, two planes crossing in perspective, per-draw
  scissors, a quad's split, and a copy's clear;
- lines: every pixel either side drew is within one pixel of one the other
  drew (the CPU steps a line in ceil(length) floor()ed samples; Vulkan
  rasterizes by diamond exit, so endpoints and half-pixel steps may differ);
- points: exactly the CPU's pixels.

An edge pixel is one whose 3x3 neighbourhood in the CPU's image is not one
colour (for the gradients, not all covered or all uncovered): Vulkan's
top-left fill rule and the CPU's inclusive one disagree there by design.

`tevdiff` (V3b) runs tev.glsl, the TEV transcribed, against tev_pixel over
setups tev_prepare built from random registers: zero mismatches, and every
path it counts taken at least 100 times. `copydiff` (V3b) runs the same random
copies through the CPU renderer and through gxv's compute copy, in two
processes at once, and compares what each left in RAM, the decoded image and a
screen copy: byte for byte, with every refused copy leaving RAM as it was.
`loddiff` (V5) runs lod.glsl, the fragment stage's level of detail, against
the sampler's own level choice (tex_level) bit for bit, and against span_lod's
formula within 1/1024, the derivatives given to both, since V0 does not
reliably see a level's blur (FINDINGS "V4").

`oracle` (V4a, V4b) replays every capture of --set (corpus,perfset; add
gpuset for V1's): on the CPU, a reference that must hash to the manifest
(corpus) or equal V0's inspected image, and on the GPU, which V0 judges. A
frame that copies to a texture is replayed from a scratch copy with 0xA5 over
every row of tiles it copies into (3.12's poison). A failure must be listed
in BY_DESIGN, bisected. --mutations then runs the GPU mutations, each of which must fail
V0 wherever it changes 0.5% of a frame, on five captures or more, but for the
exceptions GPU_BLIND_SPOTS and SHORT_OF_FIVE list. `time` gives the GPU's and
the consumer's milliseconds a frame, beside perfbench's CPU figures.

`logicop` (V4b) draws the mask effect's 14 captures with native logic ops,
the blend approximation and the EFB snapshot, which must give byte-identical
frames; `ramdiff` holds every copy's bytes, CPU against GPU, and traces each
difference to the EFB the copy read; `chain` carries each frame's copies into
the next frame's RAM, as V1's battle start needs.

`contrast` (V5) replays every capture of --set through the spike and through gen/soa.exe --replay with
SOA_GPU=vulkan, from one scratch copy of it, and holds the two pictures to the
same pixels, with both runs' start lines naming the same device and driver.
--mutate hands one of gxv's mutations to soa.exe alone (SOA_GPU_MUTATE), and
the pictures must then differ, failing it.

`copyimage` (V7) draws a frame that copies to an RGBA8 texture and samples
the copy in the same frame, on the CPU and the GPU: the GPU must give the
CPU's hash and all 16 cells, serve the sampler from the copy's image in its
pool, and land the copy with the frame's submission rather than a wait of
its own. --mutate cimg-cpu (the producer's image, not yet landed, sampled)
and land-at-copy (V6's wait at each copy) must fail it.

`logictest` (V10) draws two synthetic logic-op scenes -- an OR quad, and two
overlapping triangles XORed -- through every route: the OR must be 0xFF but for
the forced blend's 198, and the overlapping XOR must come back black where
SOA_GPU_FEATURES=nologicop routes it to the interlock, and be a snapshot named
in a line, never a blend, under core.

`present` (V8) draws two synthetic screen copies through the GPU presenter's
pass into eight target sizes at both layouts (integer and fit) and holds each
to picture_scale's picture, the CPU presenter's, every pixel's colour exact.
--mutate present (one column over) must fail it.

`specdiff` (V7) replays every capture of --set on the GPU twice, every draw
specialised on the TEV's shape (SOA_GPU_SPECIALIZE=wait) and the interpreter
alone (0), and holds the two to the same bytes. --mutate spec-stages (a
stage dropped from the specialised shape) must fail it.

--specialize (V7) gives every run a command makes SOA_GPU_SPECIALIZE: wait
draws every draw with its pipeline specialised on the TEV's shape, made on
the draw path; 0 with the interpreter alone; 1, gxv's default, with the
interpreter until the compiler thread has made the specialised one. The
oracle's pictures must be the same under all three.

`queue` (V6a) draws one synthetic frame through the producer and the GPU on
its own thread: 64 quads each sampling the same texture slot at a new
generation, then 656,000 vertices that fill the producer's vertex arena
twice. On the GPU, three times on the thread, once inline (V5's path) and
once with the consumer stalled, it must give the CPU's frame hash, every
quad its own texture, and two arena drains on the thread. --mutate
pool-in-place (a slot's allocation rewritten under recorded draws) or
count-early (a variant build counting a command before it runs, stalled)
must fail it.

`overlap` (V6b) runs tools/citest/queue_check.py's overlap stream -- textures,
palettes and indexed vertex colours read from copy destinations, a copy
written twice, tokens, GXDrawDone, a hook's poke -- with the GPU as the
queue's consumer, unstalled, stalled before its draws, copies or clears, and
with SOA_GXR_TOKENWAIT=1. Every final hash the one-worker CPU run prints
must come out the same, but the EFB's, which is on the GPU. --mutate
late-readback (a copy's bytes landing after it is counted) must fail it.

`live` (after V5) runs a scenario through scenario.py three times -- on the
CPU twice and with SOA_GPU=vulkan once -- and holds each GPU snapshot to the
CPU's by V0: the scenario's own every N frames, or with --range every frame
from A to B. It is what replays cannot show: copies and textures carried from
frame to frame in a running game. A running game is not reproducible: it
reseeds from the clock, which SOA_SEED pins, and much of it is timed by the
clock, which follows the host's pace, so only the frames the two CPU runs
make byte for byte alike are judged; the rest are counted as not judged
(FINDINGS "V5, after").

--mutate names a mutation the command must fail on: unclipped (selftest),
clamp (tevdiff), rounding, intensity and unseeded (copydiff), lod and
lodmin (loddiff), and-copy,
or-copy and or-and (logicop), dest+32 (ramdiff), any gxv mutation for
soa.exe alone (contrast). Exit 0 pass,
1 fail, 3 skipped (no compiler, no vendor/, no Vulkan device), the reason
printed.
