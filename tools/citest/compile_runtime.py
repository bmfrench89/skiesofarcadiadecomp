"""Compile every runtime/*.c on its own, no linking and no generated code.

    python tools/citest/compile_runtime.py [--cc msvc|clang-cl|gcc|clang] [--out build/citest/runtime]

The runtime is the part of the port that is actually hand-written C, and
until this existed nothing built it except the owner's machine, so a syntax
error in runtime/ could reach main unnoticed. Each translation unit is
compiled with /c and the flags tools/soa/toolchain.py gives every unit, which
needs no disc, no gen/ and no link step: each runtime file declares for
itself the recompiled symbols it calls. A handful of warnings that mean a call
does not match the function it names -- the implicit declaration first among
them -- are promoted to errors here, since nothing links and they are all a
link step would have caught. Prints one line per file, with the compiler's
warnings underneath, and exits non-zero if any file fails or the compiler is
missing. --cc clang-cl builds with the clang-cl profile instead
(tools/soa/toolchain.py; portability.md 3.9), its own flags and strict set,
into build/citest/runtime-clang-cl.

gxv.c is compiled twice: as every file is, which is the stub a build without
the GPU backend links, and with SOA_GXV=1, which is the backend (V5). The
second needs Vulkan-Headers (python tools/fetch_gpu.py --headers) and is
given one-word stand-ins for the SPIR-V headers (tools/soa/shaders.py stub),
so it compiles all of the backend's C on any machine, glslang or not; without
the headers it is reported as not compiled, and --require-gxv, which CI
passes, makes that a failure.

window_sdl.c and audio_sdl.c, the window and the sound off Windows
(portability L10), are empty without SOA_SDL, so on Linux's gcc and clang
they are compiled again with SOA_SDL=1 against SDL3's headers (python
tools/fetch_sdl.py --headers), with the three files whose code SOA_SDL
changes; without the headers they are reported as not compiled, and
--require-sdl, which CI's Linux legs pass, makes that a failure.
