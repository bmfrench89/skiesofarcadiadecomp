"""The binding lists: config/hle.txt, hooks.txt, savepoints.txt and trace.txt.

All four go through tools/soa/hle.py load_bindings, and all four are baked
into the translated C, so a line the loader does not read is a function the
runtime was meant to answer that the recompiled code answers instead, a hook
or a savepoint that is not there, or a tracepoint that never fires -- and a
full recompile later, nothing says so. The loader used to skip any line it
could not match: `0X80005520`, `0x8000552` and `80005520` each vanished with
no error and no count, which CLAUDE.md carried as a known silent trap. A
second entry for an address replaced the first just as quietly.
