"""Tests for the early depth test's premise (PLAN-60FPS-MODS H15a).

The renderer now tests depth before the TEV whenever a draw's alpha compare
passes every alpha a fragment can have, because then the order of the two
tests cannot change a pixel and the TEV is spared every fragment depth would
discard. Everything rests on ``alpha_always`` being right, and the plan names
the trap: two compares that always pass, joined by XOR, never pass. So these
cases are chosen by hand, with the answer worked out from the hardware's
definition rather than from the code, and include every logic op over the
always and never compares, a reference at each end of the range, and the
cache the function keeps between draws.

The driver includes gxr_tev.c itself, to call the static function. No disc and
no game data.
