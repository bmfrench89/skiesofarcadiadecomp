"""The EFB copy's vertical filter (PLAN C3).

The console runs a filter over the EFB as it copies, and its seven six-bit
weights are the thing this test exists to pin down, because they are not seven
rows and the plan said they were for two days. They are vertical sub-samples:
two belong to the row above, three to the row itself and two to the row below.
So the game's 8,8,10,12,10,8,8 is 16/64, 32/64, 16/64 across three rows, and
*nothing* lands two or three rows away.

The zeros at distance two and three are the half of the expectation that
discriminates. A test asserting only "the neighbours get 16/64" passes under
the refuted reading too, and would have blessed it.

The second case is the one that can fail for the right reason. The SDK's own
filter-off coefficients, {0,0,21,22,21,0,0}, put all 64 units of weight on taps
2, 3 and 4 -- so under the correct grouping they are the exact identity and the
copy must come out bit for bit as it did before C3. A wrong collapse that
happens to yield 16/32/16 for the game's set will still fail this one.

Everything here writes the EFB directly and copies it out, so the rasterizer is
not in the picture: what is being checked is the copy, not a rendering. The
build follows ``tools/citest/render_check.py`` -- gx.c, gxr.c, gxr_tev.c and
png.c reach only two symbols outside themselves. No disc, no recompiled code,
no window.
