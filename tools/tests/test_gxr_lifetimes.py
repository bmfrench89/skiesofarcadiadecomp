"""Tests for the lifetime rules the renderer's queue lives by.

A queued draw holds raw pointers into the decoded-texture cache -- TexCfg
carries ``const uint8_t* level[MAX_MIPS]`` by value inside the DrawCmd -- and a
worker thread dereferences them for as long as it is rasterizing that command.
Two rules follow, and neither can be read off the source:

* a draw is published in the slot it was built in, so what a worker executes is
  the draw the producer just wrote and not a command that has already run;
* no decoded texture is handed back to the allocator while a queued draw, or
  the draw being built right now, can still reach it.

Both used to be broken by the same thing: ``tev_prepare`` flushes when a draw
samples a texture a queued EFB copy has not written yet, and a flush recycles
the queue, the vertex arena and the texture graveyard. The first test below
drives exactly that shape; before the fix it drew the wrong command. The second
piles up more freed textures between two drains than any fixed-size list would
hold, which is what a mass TLUT invalidation does with a full queue.

Built the way ``test_gxr_tripwires.py`` builds it: the renderer on its own, a
synthetic command stream, no disc and no game data.
