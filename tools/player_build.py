"""Build the game into a folder from a disc image: what a player's setup runs.

    python tools/player_build.py --disc <image.rvz|iso|gcm> --root <folder>

specs/distribution.md R2. One command, from the player's own disc image to a
folder that plays:

1. **The disc is checked before any work** (3.8): its game id must be GEAE8P
   and its executable's SHA-1 the one config/ describes, each refused by
   name; an image that is not a GameCube disc, and one this cannot check, are
   refused too.
2. **What the game reads is extracted** into <root>/extracted (the image the
   runtime reads, and sys/), as tools/extract.py does.
3. **Never a stale gen/:** every input the translated C bakes in is hashed
   into <root>/gen/build-inputs.txt. When any differs from the last build's,
   the old translation is thrown away and the game is translated again, and
   the log says which input moved. --rebuild translates again whatever the
   record says: the setup window's Rebuild (3.8).
4. **The build:** recompile.py with the bundled compiler (the mingw profile:
   SOA_MINGW, the package's toolchain/, or vendor/), --no-decomp (no src/ in
   a package, 3.1) and --reproducible, on every core.
5. soa.exe and the mods' mod.dll go to the top of <root>, and soa.ini is
   written, unless one is there already.

It prints one machine-readable line per step and translation unit --
`[build] check`, `[build] 7/19 chunk_006.c` -- which the setup window (R4)
reads, and ends with `[build] done soa.exe sha256 <hex>`. Exit status 0 when
the folder plays, 1 when a step failed, 2 when the disc was refused.
