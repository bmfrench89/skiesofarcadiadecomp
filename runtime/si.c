/*
 * Serial interface: the four controller ports, as the SDK's SI and PAD
 * drivers see them. One standard controller in port 1; nothing elsewhere.
 *
 * Two paths reach the controller. Direct transfers (SITransfer): the CPU
 * puts a command in the I/O buffer at 0xCC006480, writes SICOMCSR with
 * TSTART, and gets the response back in the same buffer with TCINT and an
 * SI interrupt. Polling (SIEnablePolling): once SIPOLL enables a channel
 * the hardware sends that channel's OUTBUF command every field and lands
 * the 8-byte reply in INBUFH/INBUFL with RDST set in SISR, optionally
 * interrupting. PADRead reads INBUF; reading INBUFL clears RDST.
 *
 * Input comes from the window when there is one, else from a script
 * (SOA_PAD="frame:buttons,..." -- e.g. "1700:start,1800:a+sup" holds
 * START from the game's frame 1700, and A with the stick up from 1800,
 * each for 10 frames; sup/sdown/sleft/sright move the stick; "3600:a@150"
 * presses A at frame 3600 and again every 150 frames after that).
 *
 * SOA_PAD_RECORD=<path> writes down what the port actually read, keyed by
 * the frame gx.c counts, and SOA_PAD_FILE=<path> plays that back in place
 * of any live or scripted input. A script can only say "these twelve
 * buttons, that stick, all the way"; a recording carries both sticks and
 * both triggers at the values the player gave them, which is the only way a
 * run long enough to reach a save point can be repeated. A replay ends the
 * run a little after the recording's last line (SOA_PAD_STOP), so a headless
 * replay needs no SOA_FRAMES guessed in advance.

 *   # 5 state changes over 1181 frames, 2634 retraces
 *
 * The fields are frame, buttons, main stick, C stick, triggers; "-" is no
 * buttons, "+" joins them, and trailing fields that are centred or zero are
 * left off. A frame with no line of its own holds the state the line before
 * it set, so only changes need writing: a minute of play is a few hundred
 * lines rather than three and a half thousand frames, and the result stays
 * small enough to read, annotate with # comments and cut by hand at the line
 * where the save point was reached -- which is how a usable recording will
 * actually be made, by playing loosely and then trimming. Text, one line per
 * event, is also the only format a diff can say anything useful about.
 *
 * The last line a run writes is the neutral state one frame past the last
 * read, so that a recording which ended with a button held does not hold it
 * forever on replay, and a # line after it gives the totals. Both are for
 * the person trimming; the replay adds its own neutral state when the file
 * does not end in one, which is what makes a Ctrl-C'd or hand-cut recording
 * safe to replay.
 *
 * What v2 adds, and why. A frame is the right key for the game's logic --
 * the guest consumes exactly one pad state per frame it presents -- but it is
 * not a clock: frames are produced as fast as the host manages while
 * everything the game waits on (retraces, DVD, the decrementer) runs on guest
 * time, and saved runs differ by 30% in retraces per frame between windowed
 * rendering and headless. So the same input arrives at a different point in
 * the game's own time, with no resynchronisation, and a long recording walks
 * off. Nothing here fixes that -- PLAN D4, a deterministic guest clock, is
 * the fix -- but v2 makes it visible and refuses to be quiet about it:
 *
 *   #r<n> on each line is irq.c's retrace count when that state was read, so
 *   a replay can say how far it has drifted from the run that recorded it,
 *   in guest time, rather than walking into the wrong menu silently;
 *   # config records the switches that change the frame rate and the memory
 *   card the run started from, and a replay says so when they differ.
 *
 * Both are comments: a v1 recording still replays, a hand-written line still
 * works, and a hand-edited one only loses the drift check for that line. */
