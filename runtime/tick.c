/*
 * VIGetRetraceCount (0x8023F704), answered natively, so that the game's main
 * loop has a safe point and a tick the port can let go early
 * (docs/PLAN-60FPS-MODS.md M2).
 *
 * The original is two instructions, `lwz r3,-27836(r13); blr`: the retrace
 * count at 0x80347A64. Two of its callers are the main loop's:
 *
 *   801DCB84 bl VIGetRetraceCount   the top of the loop, which stores the
 *   801DCB88 stw r3,-28820(r13)     count as the frame's start (0x8034768C)
 *
 *   801DC498 bl VIGetRetraceCount   the frame end's spin, after the XFB copy:
 *   801DC49C lwz r0,-28820(r13)     it goes round while count - start < 1,
 *   801DC4A0 subf r0,r0,r3          each pass behind fn_801C6248(0)'s wait
 *   801DC4A4 cmpli cr0,r0,1         for a retrace -- the immediate that makes
 *   801DC4A8 blt 801DC490           the game two fields a frame
 *
 * Every translated call sets lr first, so the call site is s->lr here:
 *
 * - At 0x801DCB88, before the count is read, the safe-point callbacks run.
 *   Nothing of the frame has started: no GX, no guest thread mid-update --
 *   the one point a mod may call guest code (M4) or change what the frame
 *   does.
 * - At 0x801DC49C, once the tick is unlocked (SOA_UNCAP=N, from frame N), the
 *   answer is the frame's start plus one, so the spin leaves on its first
 *   pass and a frame needs the one field fn_801C6248 waits for, not two. The
 *   game's logic advances once a frame (FINDINGS "H2"), so this is the whole
 *   game at up to twice the speed -- a battle speed-up (M11) or a
 *   measurement, never 60 fps. H3 did the same by zeroing the stored start;
 *   answering here leaves that word as the game wrote it.
 * - Anywhere else, and at both with nothing registered and the tick locked,
 *   it is the original, and selftest's twin case holds it to the recompiled
 *   one.
