/*
 * The external interface: three channels of chip-selected serial devices.
 *
 *   channel 0, device 0  memory card in slot A (a file, formatted by the game)
 *   channel 0, device 1  the RTC/SRAM (settings and the clock), the IPL ROM (not provided)
 *   channel 1, device 0  slot B: empty
 *   channel 2            nothing
 *
 * Transfers are immediate (1-4 bytes through EXI_DATA) or DMA (EXI_MAR /
 * EXI_LENGTH); each completes at once with TCINT, and the TC interrupt is
 * raised when the SDK enables it. Devices see a byte stream framed by the
 * chip select, which is how the real ones work.
 *
 *   0xCC006800 + 0x14*ch: CSR, MAR, LENGTH, CR, DATA
 *   CSR: EXIINTMSK 0, EXIINT 1, TCINTMSK 2, TCINT 3, CLK 4-6, CS0B 7, CS1B 8, CS2B 9,
 *        EXTINTMSK 10, EXTINT 11, EXT 12 (device present), ROMDIS 13
 *   CR:  TSTART 0, DMA 1, RW 2-3 (0 read, 1 write, 2 read/write), TLEN 4-5 (bytes-1)
 *
 * A card has two interrupts, not one. TCINT says the bus finished moving
 * bytes; EXIINT is the card itself, pulling its interrupt line when a program
 * or erase it was left to do has finished. The CARD library waits on the
 * second one for every write, so a device that raises only the first makes
 * every save sit out a 100 ms timeout and fail.
